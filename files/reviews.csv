1, 13 Aug 2017,"""Worst experience of my life""",1.0,"All employees are nice. They always help each other. Otherwise management is too worst. They never like to treat employee like an employee. Always treat with them like labour. If you are good in your work,you will always be therefor them. Never expect any kind response from other side.",Hire n Fire is very common these days. But if you expect any growth on behalf on your strengths. Then you are a fool. The only way to growth is switching the job. Otherwise you will be at same position for your whole life. They will hire a new one over you on a handsome package. But never want to see you at that position.
2, 12 Aug 2017,"""Worst One""",1.0,1. Salary on time (most probably in first 3 days of month).,"The list goes will go on but I'll try to wrap in few points.1. Arrogant and stubborn CEO. He don't listen to anyone, literally no one. A fake demonstration of suggestion consideration is carried out at the end of every month. Fake means he don't give a damn what you speak for suggestion.2. No growth. As far as development is considered, they bring projects which merely has deadlines of max 40 days. Don't you ever think that you are going to get some deep knowledge because if you start searching new things, the deadline will cross your path. LAME!3. Poor evaluation of resources. No matter how much you are dedicated to your work, at the end of the day you will be surprised with your low appraisal (with the low I mean really very low).4. Poor appraisal policy. They make appraisal without discussing it with the employee and give unrealistic and impractical reasons on the performance issues.5. Moron HR. Sir, why are you here? HR has just one work which is to flatter CEO. He wags his tail and say whatever CEO say. Policies are poor. An employee is just in a strangling position when he resigns. No compensations or negotiations are carried out."
3, 9 Aug 2017,"""Fake Management | Full Laiers""",1.0,"Nothing positive in this company even though they will pay you nothing in term your caliber and salary is like peanuts and half salary at the end of month| CEO is showing big clap to data-mining but indirectly ruining them slowly.Dont join this company, you will regret later, Decide today",They pay you nothing and all the fresher and even though CEO look like fresher in term on knowledge of expertise. HR one of Full CHAPLOOS and crap and he decide business target and even though he dont know how to do sales. If he as what you can achieve then ask he has closed any deal till date in his life
4, 8 Aug 2017,"""reviews""",1.0,if your marks is less than 60% then join.Salary on time.Hello fresher employee don't be hesitate in the company.,Down side is the company is that the company work on windows from application and scrape the data.Team leader have not knowledge.No increment.treat as a labour.

Work is not the same as offered designation .2.In last two months 20-25 employees resigned that clearly indicates how stable the company is ?3. Team Leaders Review:- It requires another section to be made.                             -Carries vast knowledge of nothing.                             -Do politics most of the time.                             -Their only goal is to make good impression in front of Companies                               owner.
